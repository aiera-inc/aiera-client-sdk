# Aiera Client SDK

The client SDK contains tools to interact with Aiera's backend APIs as well as widgets that can be embedded in other web applications to embed Aiera's functionality. The widgets are developed to be platform agnostic using a messaging system to allow for platform-specific implementations for FDC3 contexts, notifications, etc. The widgets are exposed as React components which are exported alongside a number of custom hooks and utilities to interact with Aiera's APIs.

An Aiera account is needed to access any of the functionality.

This repo is currently used internally for building out Aiera widgets for external systems and is documented/maintained as such. However we've open sourced it to allow for others to embed this functionality as well. If these external use cases become more common we will provide additional documentation, tutorials and other materials to help developers embed Aiera widgets into their applications.

Documentation for this repo can be found [here](https://aiera-inc.github.io/aiera-client-sdk/docs/index.html).
